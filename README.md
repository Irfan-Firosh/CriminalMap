# CriminalMap: Visualizing Crime Logs as a Heatmap
CriminalMap is a Python program designed to scrape crime logs and convert them into a heatmap for data visualization purposes. It aggregates over 11 weeks of data from Purdue University's criminal logs, providing a comprehensive overview of criminal activity on campus.

# Tools Utilized
The project leverages several Python tools to achieve its objectives:

Beautiful Soup: Utilized for web scraping, Beautiful Soup extracts data from the website efficiently and effectively.
Pandas and NumPy: These libraries are employed for data filtering and processing tasks, ensuring seamless manipulation of the extracted data.
GeoCoders: GeoCoders aids in obtaining location coordinates and other relevant details necessary for accurate mapping.
Fusion: Fusion is employed to construct the heatmap, providing an intuitive and visually appealing representation of criminal activity distribution.

# Significance and Utility
CriminalMap holds significant utility, particularly for students and faculty members seeking to navigate the campus safely. By visualizing crime rates and hotspots, individuals can make informed decisions about their movements, helping them avoid areas with higher instances of criminal activity.
